# Frontend Mentor

### Introduction
Hello there! This repository is where I keep all of my submissions to Frontend Mentor challenges. Frontend Mentor has a collection of challenges where they provide you with a design, and you can practice recreating them with whatever technologies you like. I am following along these challenges to learn and improve at my frontend development, especially my CSS and React skills.

### Code
All the code is stored in this repository. Each package represents a single challenge, each with an introductory README.md file that includes a brief summary of the expectations, processes, and things I learned throughout completing the challenge.
