### Links
This was my first time using Netlify, since I started using React and didn't want to create a new repository for each challenge. The images aren't working properly, but you can refer to the screenshots above to see what it should look like. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run it locally.

- Live Site URL: [Netlify Article Preview Component](https://michlam-article-preview-component.netlify.app/)

## My process
- Installed React with Vite and imported the original content
- Created the desktop design, as well as the mouse interactions
- Created the mobile design, as well as the interactions
- Deployed to Netlify

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library



### What I learned
This was a fantastic experience for me to put my React skills to the test. From creating the application, to custom components, to state logic, to deployment on Netlify, I learned a lot completing this challenge. I hope to continue to use React for future challenges, and for my skills to improve as well.
