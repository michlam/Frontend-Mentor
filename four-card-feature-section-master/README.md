### What I learned

After doing some practice with React, as well as the previous Frontend Mentor challenges, I'm really getting the hang of challenges of this level. I am able to quickly visualize how I can structure the entire website, as well as think ahead for how each component will be created and how the mobile media queries will be done. I also learned a great deal about flex boxes, particularly to solve the center column for this challenge.
