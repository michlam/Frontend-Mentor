## My process
- Set the background
- Set the main card and its flexbox
- Set the image and main content for desktop
- Add responsiveness for mobile devices

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot about flexboxes, especially getting a better idea of how I can arrange rows and columns to make the website follow the look that I want. It was difficult to get the image changes to work, since the picture tag wasn't scaling the way I wanted it to, but I managed to make it work. I also got more experience with media queries, which is always nice.
