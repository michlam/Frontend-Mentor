## My process
- Plan out text in html
- Create card
- Place and resize illustration
- Create tag for "learning"
- Continue with the rest of the main text
- Add an author section for the avatar and name

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned quite a lot about flex boxes, alignments, and how to manipulate images and text. It was a bit difficult to figure out how to get the image alignments centered while keeping the text alignments left-aligned, but once that was done, the rest was mostly smooth sailing.
