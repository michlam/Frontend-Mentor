### What I learned

This was my first experience with CSS grids, and I found the experience a lot nicer than I expected. Since I had spent most of my time with flex boxes up until now, I wasn't sure if I could learn grids too easily, but it wasn't bad. Also, as the challenges get more complex, I'm continuously thinking about how I could use React instead of normal HTML and CSS. Even if I don't use React, the process of thinking of how I would do each design is good practice itself.
