### What I learned
While I didn't learn too much new for this challenge, it was great practice, particularly with useState, forms, and buttons. Getting more practice with an actual application, rather than only UI is always a good opporrtunity. It also gave me a good benchmark as to how quickly I can create a simple frontend based off of a design.
