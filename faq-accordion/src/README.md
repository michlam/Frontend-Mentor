### What I learned

Surprisingly, this was my first time creating an accordion menu. I thought it would take some annoying state to pull off, but it turns out HTML comes with some neat functionality with the details and summary elements. With some cool styling and pseudo-elements, I was able to recreate the design fairly well. I also worked on my speed and debugging, which is always great.
